# De-Risking Strategy: From HIGH-RISK to MODERATE/LOW-RISK AI
## Maintaining Impact While Reducing Regulatory Risk

**Goal:** Reduce EU AI Act risk classification while maintaining the same value proposition for investors and users.

---

## 🎯 CURRENT RISK CLASSIFICATION

### HIGH-RISK AI (Current)
- **Skills Matching** → Used for recruitment/employment decisions
- **Regulatory Burden:** Heavy compliance, audits, certifications
- **Investor Concern:** High liability, complex compliance

### TARGET: MODERATE/LOW-RISK AI
- **Skills Discovery** → User empowerment tool, not hiring decision
- **Regulatory Burden:** Minimal compliance, transparency only
- **Investor Appeal:** Lower liability, faster to market

---

## 💡 DE-RISKING STRATEGY: "User Empowerment" Model

### Core Principle: **AI Assists, User Decides, Employer Chooses**

**Shift from:** AI makes hiring recommendations  
**Shift to:** AI helps users understand their skills and find opportunities

---

## 🔄 TRANSFORMATION: Skills Matching → Skills Discovery

### BEFORE (HIGH-RISK):
```
AI Matches Skills → Recommends Jobs → Employer Hires
❌ AI is in the decision chain
❌ HIGH-RISK AI classification
```

### AFTER (LOW-RISK):
```
AI Analyzes Skills → User Sees Opportunities → User Applies → Employer Decides
✅ AI is informational only
✅ LOW-RISK AI classification
```

### Key Changes:

1. **No Direct Employer Connection**
   - AI doesn't send matches to employers
   - Users see opportunities and apply themselves
   - Employer makes decision independently

2. **User-Facing Only**
   - AI helps users understand their skills
   - AI shows relevant opportunities
   - User decides which jobs to apply for

3. **Transparency & Education**
   - AI explains skills match
   - User learns about job requirements
   - User makes informed decisions
